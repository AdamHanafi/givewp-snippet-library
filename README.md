# Give Snippet Library

A collection of code snippets to enhance or expand on the free Give WordPress Donation Plugin. Be sure to customize the function names or wrap with `function_exists` contionals to avoid collisions. 

If you need assistance implementing custom PHP code on your WordPress website, we have this guide:

For custom CSS see this guide:

Please note that these code snippets are provided as examples of how you can extend Give with code. Itâ€™s up to you to implement and customize to your liking. We cannot provide support for custom code, even code derived from these snippets, on your website.

We review and accept PRs. Have something the Give community could benefit from? Submit a PR today!
